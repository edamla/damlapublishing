Mehmet just finished reading his book. He started
thinking about how he started reading. Once upon a time, he
was in elementary school, and he had homework. But he just
couldn’t do it. He found the solution; pretending he was sick
and not going to school. It was not that easy to get rid of
the school; his teacher called his mother and told her that he
must hand the homework over today. And her mother thought
she should do something about this. In the evening, Mehmet’s
father talked with him for a long time, but it didn’t seem to
help. But Nermin, his father’s assistant, was going to do the
magical touch to his life. One day she explained how reading
books would change his world and she taught him how to
read. Since that day, Mehmet always had a book in his hand.
He became a total bookworm. He was looking forward to
getting the new book of the series he read, saving his pocket
money to buy them. The big moment has come and the new
book of the series was published. But it was so expensive
that his savings weren’t enough. He waited for a sale, but the
edition of the book was constantly running out of stock and
there was no room for a sale. Mehmet and Soner started working to learn about work-life earlier. Soner was
an apprentice at a teashop, and Mehmet was working in a print shop. They were going working in their spare
time left from school. One day, Soner came up with a book that Mehmet was looking forward to buying. When
he saw the price of the book was very low, he decided to buy and give it as a gift to his friend. Mehmet and his
friends were very happy to find a cheap book and they began to buy books from that bookshop. After these
cheap books, Burak, the son of a publisher, was cast out in the classroom. Because everyone thought his
father was selling the books too expensive. Burak could not stand this situation any longer and he told the
class that what they do is wrong. He said, “You buy pirated printing books and others get undeserved gain
rather than the owner of the books.” Everybody in the classroom was shocked. Then they understood the
mistake they made. And they started investigating the book pirates. First, they teamed up and alternately
tried to get more information from the bookstores that sell pirated books. They were all doing their best.
After a while, someone’s mother bought a book on the internet and it turned out that the book was a pirated
book. Then they decided to go after this. First they tried to identify the publishing house that sent the cargo,
but unfortunately, the result was negative since there was no publishing house. So they decided to continue
by searching the person who brought the book to them. Meanwhile, Hakan and Çağrı started to work in
the warehouse where they were investigating suspicious things. In fact, all these events were related to
each other. The printing house that Mehmet worked at, the painter at Burak’s father’s publishing house,
the warehouse where Hakan and Çağrı worked, and the pirate book dealer and his deliveryman all worked
together.
Çağrı had attracted attention.
And the team was about to enlighten this chain of pirating. But Hakan and Çağrı got the pirates’ attention.
The pirates immediately detained them and their friends did not hear from them for a while. One of them
managed to escape and the other was taken to another place, the publishing house where Mehmet used to
work. They were all working really hard. They were getting closer to the end. But there was nothing they
could do for a solution. First, they informed the principal of the school. He just listened to the kids and sent
them home. He didn’t think that the children were under such a big threat. Things were going too far. In one
hand, they couldn’t hear from Çağrı and on the other, Mehmet said he was in danger. Burak could not stand
anymore and go to the police. Police immediately raided the places that were described. He rescued the
children and arrested the labor thieves, pirates.

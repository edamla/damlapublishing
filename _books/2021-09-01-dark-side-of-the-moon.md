They didn’t mean to have an adventure or fun. They were filled
with excitement of discovering a new planet to settle.
Will Spacecraft Irus 8011 make it happen?
Will Captain Aka make it happen by the help of his talented and
smart crew?
Will the folks in the spacecraft get along with each other?
Will the ecosystem garden be enough for their needs?
Where will the shockwaves drag them into?
How will the results of this adventure affect them?
Will these folks who lived on different planets and went through
many hardships find a new place to live?
The civilization of Irus, on the dark side of the moon, will take you
to places that you have never been or heard of before and will
drag you into an ultimate adventure...

Fatma and Ali are involved in a brawl at school and Ali gets really sad because of this. Fatma
consoles Ali as a good friend. This incident is being forgotten soon at school because everyone
starts thinking about the week of domestic goods. But Fatma sees the week of domestic goods is
deviating from its purpose. And she shares her feelings with Ali about this problem. Ali has had a
great idea. They want to create a brochure about the hunger in the world and they will distribute

As a kid, she always thought that the writers were the illustrators of their own books. So, she started drawing pictures for her own books when she was still a little kid.
When she grew up, she started working with different publishing houses as an illustrator.
She took her first step as an author by writing “Little Ladies in the Kitchen” and also did the illustrations in her book by herself.

Now, she only does illustrations for her own books. When she is asked ‘why only for her own books?’ she says that she has too many ideas to write about.

She was born in Erzurum in 1956 and completed her primary school education in the same province.
In 1968, she passed an exam and got the right to study in Yavuz Selim Boarding School and was honoured to be the best student when she graduted from this school in 1975.
At the same year, she started working as a teacher in Gozalan Village in Erzurum.
After working as a teacher in many primary schools in villages around Turkey, she returned to Erzurum and continued working in the same province until her retirement.

Ms. Özeren started to be interested in literature through the fairy tales, national stories, the lives of poets, the lives of national heroes and their adventures. The stories of ordinary people, the mystery of the nature and the special bounds that she has for the children through the nature of her profession directed her to start writing.
After 33 years of successful career as a teacher, she got retired but still works as a primary school teacher in a private college in Erzurum. She is married and a mother to two children. She has more than 250 different titles published by Damla Publishing.
